# PolideaPlayground / time-o-fill

Polidea Timesheets made simple.

# Quick start

```bash
nvm install
npm install --global npm
npm install
npm start
```

The app run in development mode should open automatically
in your browser.

First step is optional, because you can provide proper Node version
on your own. But if you like to manage multiple Node versions, then
[nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) is a way to go :-)
Here it uses Node version based on `.nvmrc` stored in the repository.

Second step is here in order to make sure that you use npm 5 or newer.
